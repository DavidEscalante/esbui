# BATTLEFIELD 2042 FLASHPOINT UI
This is intended for personal use in the Esport Battlefield Tournament. It is mostly designed to be used on a smartphone as a secondary display, but it runs just fine on any desktop device.

Latest changes include:
- Reduction of the number of functions (thanks to GTP).
- Removal of a duplicated symbol on the Noshahr map.
- Visual fixes for vertically stretched screens.
